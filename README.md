# LCP

A Python implementation of Linear Complementarity Problem.

The implementation of Lemke's method is based on Chapter 1 and 2 in [Linear Complementarity, Linear and Nonlinear Programming](https://www-personal.umich.edu/~murty/books/linear_complementarity_webbook/) by Katta G. Murty.

The lexicographical minimum ratio test is implemented according to Section 2.6 in [Computing Equilibria for Two-person Games] (https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/cgt/stengel.pdf) by Bernhard von Stengel.
